## Project Description
[Our web app displays daily inspirational quotes on screens in company offices, schools, and universities, motivating students and employees while creating a positive atmosphere. It automatically updates with fresh quotes and allows customization of themes, ensuring each screen delivers visually engaging and uplifting content throughout the day.]

## Problem Statement
[The problem with physical inspirational posters - every time you want to change a quote, you have to order a new poster. This product is designed for office workers, students, and motivated individuals in general.]

## API Selection
**API Name:** [ZenQuotes API]  
**API Documentation:** [[URL](https://docs.zenquotes.io/zenquotes-documentation/)]  
**Why this API?** [This is the most efficient way for developers to load random quotes and it fits all requirements]
